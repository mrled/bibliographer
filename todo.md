# TODO

## Bookish

- Support extra links for authors pages etc in enriched data
- How to deal with conflicting data in different sources? e.g. authors listed first-last in Audible and last-first in Kindle
- Convert wikipedia cache to an apicache file, and use enriched data to override what it finds

Tasks:

- Add Kindle books to site (already ingested library)
- Ingest physical books and add to site
- Ingest libro.fm and add to site
